# MOOC_ECWMF
This repository is for me following and learning along with the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) from ECWMF on machine learning with weather and climate <br>
This course was done in 2023 <br> 
This course had three tiers: 
  1. Tier 1: ML in Weather & Climate <br>
  2. Tier 2: Concepts of Machine Learning <br>
  3. Tier 3: Practical ML applications in Weather & Climate <br>
